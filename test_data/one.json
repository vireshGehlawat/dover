However, there is a known tendency for coevolution to produce mediocre solutions. One of the main reasons for this is cycling, caused by intransitivities among a set of players. In this paper, we explore the link between coevolution and games, and revisit some of the coevolutionary literature in a games and measurement context. We propose a set of measurements to identify cycling in a population and a new algorithm that tries to minimize cycling in strictly competitive (zero sum) games. We experimentally verify our approach by evolving weighted piece counter value functions to play othello, a classic two-player perfect information board game. Our method is able to find extremely strong value functions of this type.\\n"}, {"url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2011.2144597", "date": null, "name": "Fast Approximate Max-N Monte Carlo Tree Search for Ms Pac-Man", "publisher": "IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games", "description": "We present an application of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) for the game of Ms Pac-Man. Contrary to most applications of MCTS to date, Ms Pac-Man requires almost real-time decision making and does not have a natural end state. We approached the problem by performing Monte Carlo tree searches on a five player maxn tree representation of the game with limited tree search depth. We performed a number of experiments using both the MCTS game agents (for pacman and ghosts) and agents used in previous work (for ghosts). Performance-wise, our approach gets excellent scores, outperforming previous non-MCTS opponent approaches to the game by up to two orders of magnitude.\\n"}, {"url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2011.6032021", "date": null, "name": "Learning Non-Random Moves for Playing Othello: Improving Monte Carlo Tree Search", "publisher": null, "description": "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with an appropriate tree policy may be used to approximate a minimax tree for games such as Go, where a state value function cannot be formulated easily: recent MCTS algorithms successfully combine Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to incrementally refine estimates on the game-theoretic values of the game's states. Although a game-specific value function is not required for this approach, significant improvements in performance may be achieved by derandomising the MC simulations using domain-specific knowledge. However, recent results suggest that the choice of a non-uniformly random default policy is non-trivial and may often lead to unexpected outcomes. In this paper we employ Temporal Difference Learning (TDL) as a general approach to the integration of domain-specific knowledge in MCTS and subsequently study its impact on the algorithm's performance. In particular, TDL is used to learn a linear function approximator that is used as an a priori bias to the move selection in the algorithm's default policy; the function approximator is also used to bias the values of the nodes in the tree directly. The goal of this work is to determine whether such a simplistic approach can be used to improve the performance of MCTS for the well-known board game Othello. The analysis of the results highlights the broader conclusions that may be drawn with respect to non-random default policies in general."}, {"url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2010.5593331", "date": null, "name": "A UCT Agent for Tron: Initial Investigations", "publisher": "IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)", "description": "Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) has generated a great deal of excitement in the A.I. community, mainly due to its success in Go.

While game-tree search is a staple technique for many games, this paper is, perhaps surprisingly, the first attempt we know of to apply it to Ms. Pac-Man. The approach we take is to expand a route-tree based on possible moves that the Ms. Pac-Man agent can take to depth 40, and evaluate which path is best using hand-coded heuristics. On a simulator of the game our agent has achieved a high score of 40,000, but only around 15,000 on the original game using a screen-capture interface.
