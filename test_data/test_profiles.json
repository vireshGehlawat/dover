However, there is a known tendency for coevolution to produce mediocre solutions. One of the main reasons for this is cycling, caused by intransitivities among a set of players. In this paper, we explore the link between coevolution and games, and revisit some of the coevolutionary literature in a games and measurement context. We propose a set of measurements to identify cycling in a population and a new algorithm that tries to minimize cycling in strictly competitive (zero sum) games. We experimentally verify our approach by evolving weighted piece counter value functions to play othello, a classic two-player perfect information board game. Our method is able to find extremely strong value functions of this type.\\n"}, {"url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2011.2144597", "date": null, "name": "Fast Approximate Max-N Monte Carlo Tree Search for Ms Pac-Man", "publisher": "IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games", "description": "We present an application of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) for the game of Ms Pac-Man. Contrary to most applications of MCTS to date, Ms Pac-Man requires almost real-time decision making and does not have a natural end state. We approached the problem by performing Monte Carlo tree searches on a five player maxn tree representation of the game with limited tree search depth. We performed a number of experiments using both the MCTS game agents (for pacman and ghosts) and agents used in previous work (for ghosts). Performance-wise, our approach gets excellent scores, outperforming previous non-MCTS opponent approaches to the game by up to two orders of magnitude.\\n"}, {"url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2011.6032021", "date": null, "name": "Learning Non-Random Moves for Playing Othello: Improving Monte Carlo Tree Search", "publisher": null, "description": "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with an appropriate tree policy may be used to approximate a minimax tree for games such as Go, where a state value function cannot be formulated easily: recent MCTS algorithms successfully combine Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to incrementally refine estimates on the game-theoretic values of the game's states. Although a game-specific value function is not required for this approach, significant improvements in performance may be achieved by derandomising the MC simulations using domain-specific knowledge. However, recent results suggest that the choice of a non-uniformly random default policy is non-trivial and may often lead to unexpected outcomes. In this paper we employ Temporal Difference Learning (TDL) as a general approach to the integration of domain-specific knowledge in MCTS and subsequently study its impact on the algorithm's performance. In particular, TDL is used to learn a linear function approximator that is used as an a priori bias to the move selection in the algorithm's default policy; the function approximator is also used to bias the values of the nodes in the tree directly. The goal of this work is to determine whether such a simplistic approach can be used to improve the performance of MCTS for the well-known board game Othello. The analysis of the results highlights the broader conclusions that may be drawn with respect to non-random default policies in general."}, {"url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2010.5593331", "date": null, "name": "A UCT Agent for Tron: Initial Investigations", "publisher": "IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)", "description": "Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) has generated a great deal of excitement in the A.I. community, mainly due to its success in Go.

While game-tree search is a staple technique for many games, this paper is, perhaps surprisingly, the first attempt we know of to apply it to Ms. Pac-Man. The approach we take is to expand a route-tree based on possible moves that the Ms. Pac-Man agent can take to depth 40, and evaluate which path is best using hand-coded heuristics. On a simulator of the game our agent has achieved a high score of 40,000, but only around 15,000 on the original game using a screen-capture interface.

You will also discover real production ready recipes on deploying KVM instances with OpenStack and how to programatically manage the life cycle of KVM virtual machines using Python. You will learn numerous tips and techniques which will help you deploy & plan the KVM infrastructure. Next, you will be introduced to the working of libvirt libraries and the iPython development environment.\\n\\nFinally, you will be able to tune your Linux kernel for high throughput and better performance.

Moving on, you will explore container networking, security, and backups. You will also learn how to deploy LXC with technologies like Open Stack and Vagrant.

to either an assembled or previously annotated transcriptome, followed by an optimization procedure for deconvolution of multi-mapping reads. These procedures are essential for downstream analysis such as differential expression. In cases where it is desirable to adjust the underlying annotation, for example, on the discovery of novel isoforms or errors in existing annotations, current pipelines must be rerun from scratch. This makes it difficult to update abundance estimates after re-annotation, or to explore the effect of changes in the transcriptome on analyses. We present a novel efficient algorithm for updating abundance estimates from RNA-Seq experiments on re-annotation that does not require re-analysis of the entire dataset. Our approach is based on a fast partitioning algorithm for identifying transcripts whose abundances may depend on the added or deleted isoforms, and on a fast follow-up approach to re-estimating abundances for all transcripts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by showing how to synchronize RNA-Seq abundance estimates with the daily RefSeq incremental updates. Thus, we provide a practical approach to maintaining relevant databases of RNA-Seq derived abundance estimates even as annotations are being constantly revised.

Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results.

FSA uses its explicit statistical model to produce multiple alignments which are accompanied by estimates of the alignment accuracy and uncertainty for every column and character of the alignment—previously available only with alignment programs which use computationally-expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches—yet can align thousands of long sequences. Moreover, FSA utilizes an unsupervised query-specific learning procedure for parameter estimation which leads to improved accuracy on benchmark reference alignments in comparison to existing programs. The centroid alignment approach taken by FSA, in combination with its learning procedure, drastically reduces the amount of false-positive alignment on biological data in comparison to that given by other methods.

One example is in the design of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) for genetic association studies. In this context, genetic diversity is measured by how many alleles are retained in the resulting inbred strains. RIL panels that are derived from more than two parental strains, such as the collaborative cross (Churchill et al., 2004), present a particular challenge with regard to which of the many existing lab mouse strains should be included in the initial breeding funnel in order to maximize allele retention. A similar problem occurs in the study of customer reviews when selecting a subset of products with a maximal diversity in reviews. Diversity in this case implies the presence of a set of products having both positive and negative ranks for each customer. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting an optimal diversity subset is an NP-complete problem via reduction to set cover. This reduction is sufficiently tight that greedy approximations to the set cover problem directly apply to maximizing diversity. We then suggest a slightly modified subset selection problem in which an initial greedy diversity solution is used to effectively prune an exhaustive search for all diversity subsets bounded from below by a specified coverage threshold.

These resources were generated through various breeding designs that potentially produce different genetic architectures, including the level of diversity represented, the spatial distribution of the variation, and the allele frequencies within the resource. By combining sequencing data for 16 inbred strains and the recorded history of related strains, the architecture of genetic variation in mouse resources was determined. The most commonly used resources harbor only a fraction of the genetic diversity of Mus musculus, which is not uniformly distributed thus resulting in many blind spots. Only resources that include wild-derived inbred strains from subspecies other than M. m. domesticus have no blind spots and a uniform distribution of the variation. Unlike other resources that are primarily suited for gene discovery, the CC is the only resource that can support genome-wide network analysis, which is the foundation of systems genetics. The CC captures significantly more genetic diversity with no blind spots and has a more uniform distribution of the variation than all other resources. Furthermore, the distribution of allele frequencies in the CC resembles that seen in natural populations like humans in which many variants are found at low frequencies and only a minority of variants are common. We conclude that the CC represents a dramatic improvement over existing genetic resources for mammalian systems biology applications."}], "publicIdentifier": "adam-roberts-4b04132a"}

In 2016, I graduated with distinction from Yale University with a B.A. in Art History. I was also awarded the A. Conger Goodyear Prize for my exemplary senior essay \\"What Is Ephemeral Art?\\".  After graduating, I spent two formative years working as a Yale-China Teaching Fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. During this time I also began a small side business selling one off hand painted wearable artworks ( @symbags). Although I've spent a number of years working and interning in the education field, my love for studio art and art history remains constant. I am currently a 2018-2019 Mortimer Hays-Brandeis Traveling Fellow, working on field research for my paper studying the material culture resulting from Sino-African cross-migration. After visiting Guangzhou, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Nairobi, and Addis Ababa, I am currently back in the United States working on the final essay that I will submit upon completion of my fellowship year.  \\n\\nAs an African-American “third culture kid” who spent most of my formative years growing up internationally, I am particularly fascinated by works of art that confront the complex questions of identity and navigate feelings of internal/external displacement. My family’s transient history helps me relate to powerful ideas emoted in diaspora art such as loss, confusion, migration, self-conception, identity formation, and complex relationships between tradition and modernity. Artistic representations of cross-generational migration and colonization preserve the multifaceted histories of diasporic communities.  It is in this confusing confluence and creation of culture, displayed through art, that I am most inspired.

Although accurate demographics are hard to come by, there is no doubt that emigration over the last few decades has been extensive in both directions. Approximately 2 million Chinese nationals live and work in African countries, while the number of Africans in China has been estimated at 500,000 at its highest. Through transnationalism, elements of culture such as fashion, music, and art migrate and integrate, creating amalgamations that draw inspiration from both traditions. Across Asia and Africa, artists and arts professionals have been influenced by these mergings of Chinese and African culture. This art historical-ethnographic research project aims to document the work of visual artists concerned with the relationship between China and African nations, along with the visual material culture created within the blended communities that result from Sino-African cross- migration.

Understanding its physiological effect is essential for treatment optimization and evaluation. In this study, we used diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) to investigate the changes of regional blood flow in skeletal muscle induced by a single session of LLLT. DCS is an emerging optical modality to probe microvascular blood flow in human tissues in vivo. We have developed a software-based autocorrelator system with the benefits such as flexibility in raw photon count data processing, portability and low cost. LLLT was administered at the human forearm with a 1064-nm, continuous-wave laser. The emitting power was 3.4 W in an area of 13.6 cm2, corresponding to 0.25W/cm2 irradiance. The emitting duration was 10 minutes. Eight healthy adults of any ethnic background, in an age range of 18-40 years old were included. The results indicate that LLLT causes reliable changes in regional blood flow. However, it remains unclear whether these changes are physiological or attributed to the heating effect of the stimulation laser."}, {"url": "http://www.nature.com/articles/srep30540", "date": null, "name": "Interplay between up-regulation of cytochrome-c-oxidase and hemoglobin oxygenation induced by near-infrared laser", "publisher": "Scientific Reports", "description": "Photobiomodulation, also known as low-level laser/light therapy (LLLT), refers to the use of red-to-near-infrared light to stimulate cellular functions for physiological or clinical benefits. The mechanism of LLLT is assumed to rely on photon absorption by cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), the terminal enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen for energy metabolism. In this study, we used broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure the LLLT-induced changes in CCO and hemoglobin concentrations in human forearms in vivo. Eleven healthy participants were administered with 1064-nm laser and placebo treatments on their right forearms, respectively. The spectroscopic data were analyzed and fitted with wavelength-dependent, modified Beer-Lambert Law. We found that LLLT induced significant increases of CCO concentration (Δ[CCO]) and oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (Δ[HbO]) on the treated site as the laser energy dose accumulated over time. A strong linear interplay between Δ[CCO] and Δ[HbO] was observed for the first time during LLLT, indicating a hemodynamic response of oxygen supply and blood volume closely coupled to the up-regulation of CCO induced by photobiomodulation. These results demonstrate the tremendous potential of broadband NIRS as a non-invasive, in vivo means to study mechanisms of photobiomodulation and perform treatment evaluations of LLLT."}, {"url": "https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=Translational-2016-TTu4B.6", "date": null, "name": "Improved Oxygen Metabolism in Human Tissues in vivo by Low-Level Laser Therapy", "publisher": "OSA Publishing", "description": "We assessed the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on human tissues in vivo with broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).

The implementation of online learning, however at the educational institution can lead to various challenges across three main clusters: students, faculty, and management. An overview of these challenges, based on the review of the current literature, is provided in this paper along with appropriate mitigation strategies. A generalized roadmap is established in this article that illustrates how the transition from face-to-face to online courses can be managed using a series of key steps in three critical phases during online course development: prior to, during, and post course development. The roadmap is applicable to educational institutions interested in starting their online learning journey and can provide additional guidance to institutions with an already established online presence. It facilitates the creation of well-structured online courses for students, ensures faculty are enrolled in professional development activities that support delivery of online courses, and supports managers in developing effective plans to implement technology infrastructure and create policies to support successful online learning."}], "publicIdentifier": "nagwa-abou-el-naga-363a9113"}
